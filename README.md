## About Me
Future cybersecurity professional dedicated to safeguarding systems, networks, and applications against evolving threats. With a specialization in penetration testing, threat analysis, and incident response, I work to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. My passion lies in building resilient defenses and ensuring the security and privacy of the people and organizations that rely on them. Every assessment, every log review, and every response effort is driven by a commitment to protecting others in an increasingly connected world.
